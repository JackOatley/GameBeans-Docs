		<h1>GameObjects</h1>
		
		<p>
			GameObjects are the highest level form of control you have for creating games in GameBeans. They can control and help manage anything.
			A GameObject can be the player character, a pickup, an enemy, a HUD element, or something invisible that handles some aspect of your game
			such as enemy spawning, etc.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			GameObjects can be given a Sprite that is displayed automatically when placed in a room. A GameObject placed in a room is known as an "Instance",
			as in "an instance of a GameObject". You can have 1 or many Instances of a single GameObject. Instances inherit everything from the GameObject
			they are an Instance of, but act independently after creation.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Selecting a GameObject from the resource tree opens it up in the GameObject Editor. Here's you can set it's Sprite and various other properties.
			Behaviours, Events and Actions can also be assigned to the GameObject here, they are found in the Context menu on the left.</p>
