		<h1>Objects</h1>
		
		<p>Objects are the highest level form of control you have for creating games in GameBeans. They can control and help manage anything. An Object can be the player character, a pickup, an enemy, a HUD element, or something invisible that handles some aspect of your game such as enemy spawning, etc.</p>
		
		<p>Objects can be given a Sprite that is displayed automatically when placed in a room. An Object placed in a room is known as an "Instance", as in "an instance of an object". You can have 1 or many Instances of a single Object. Instances inherit everything from the Object they are an Instance of, but act independently after creation.</p>
		
		<p>Selecting an Object from the resource tree opens it up in the Object Editor. Here's you can set it's Sprite and various other properties. Events and Actions can also be assigned to the Object here, they are found in the Context menu on the left.</p>
		
		<h4>Parameters:</h4>
