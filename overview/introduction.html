		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		
		<p>Welcome to GameBeans. GameBeans is a web-based IDE (Intergrated Development Environment) primarily targeted for use in HTML5 game creation. GameBeans aims to cater to the full spectrum of game developers, from those <span class="gb-green">Just Starting Out</span>, to <span class="gb-green">Those With Experience</span> looking for a new primary or prototyping tool.</p>
		
		<p>GameBeans is developed by myself, Jack Oatley. It's a culmination of over a decade of experience programming and creating games, both independently and professionally. The goal of creating GameBeans was to create a tool that I would use myself. I got tired of the limitations that can be placed on you by some IDEs/tools, and how they can force you to be dependant on them, and sometimes the sheer confusion and complexity of doing otherwise simple things. For a while I found comfort in doing everything by hand in a text editor, and still do. I enter a lot of game jams using JavaScript and HTML5 technologies and I find myself writing the same code every time and generally doing the same things "the hard way". So I thought, maybe I can make an IDE that actually works for a user; without limiting them, without trapping them and most importantly, without costing them for the privelege. I want GameBeans to appeal to all experience levels of users, as such it can be used as a full game making tool, or even just a JavaScript editor with the bonus of a game framework and resource management, or even a JavaScript library with no need of the IDE at all. And I want GameBeans to teach a user things they can take away with them if they decide it's no longer the tool for them.</p>
		
		
		<h3>Just Starting Out</h3>
		
		<p>GameBeans aims to be great for beginners. You will be provided with simple tools to get things on screen ASAP, along with plenty of examples and demos. If you're not comfortable with code, don't worry, GameBeans has a visual method of creating games, with as much as possible broken down into simple elements in simple places to avoid losing things and constant clicking.</p>
		
		
		<h3>Those With Experience</h3>
		
		<p>GameBeans is built on and allows full access to the JavaScript programming language. Allowing you to take full advantage of the GameBeans systems while writing everything/partially in code. Code is written in the same place Actions are placed, within Events, so it's easy to mix in if you also use visual Actions. The code editor itself features syntax highlighting that can look into the objects and functions of JavaScript as well as any libaries you have imported.</p>
