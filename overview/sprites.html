		<h1>Sprites</h1>
		
		<p>Sprites are images that are generally used to draw graphics in your game.
		They can have multiple sub-images, usually for the purpose of animation.
		They can be assigned directly to an object in the editor or by changing the object's "sprite" property.
		They can be drawn directly using drawing functions.
		They can be used as tile maps, or texture atlases for other sprites.</p>
