		<h1>Events</h1>
		
		<p>
		Events are a group of actions within an Object that execute at a particular time.
		Events can range from game loop moments like Step and Draw, to inputs and collisions between Objects.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Events:</h4>
		<p>These are the events, in their logical categories, currently available.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Game</b><ul>
				<li><b>Create</b> - Executed when a new instance of the Object is created.</li>
				<li><b>Step</b> - Executed within the game logic loop, by default this should execute 60 times a second.</li>
				<li><b>Draw</b> - Used for drawing. Executed when a new frame is about to be rendered, as such this event can run a variable number of times a second so it should not be used for game logic!</li>
				<li><b>Collision</b> - Executed when the current instance collides with another instance of a given a Object.</li>
				<li><b>Room Enter</b> - Executed after the game enters a new room.</li>
				<li><b>Room Leave</b> - Executed before the game leaves the current room.</li>
