<h1>Events</h1>

<p>
Events are a group of actions within an Object that execute at a particular
time. Events can range from game loop moments like Step and Draw, to inputs and
collisions between Objects.

<h2>Game</h2>

<div id="create" class="row">
	<img class="icon" src="images/event_create.png"/>
	<h3>Create</h3>
</div>
<p>
	The Create event is executed when a new instance of the Object is created.<br>
	In the case of an action such as Create Moving, the Create event is
	executed AFTER the changes to the speed and direction properties so the
	correct values will be present within the event.
</p>

<div id="destroy" class="row">
	<img class="icon" src="images/event_destroy.svg"/>
	<h3>Destroy</h3>
</div>
<p>
	The Destroy event is executed when the instance is destroyed by the Destroy
	action. This can be useful for changing the score when you kill an enemy, or
	creating an explosion when a bomb is destroyed.
</p>

<div if="step" class="row">
	<img class="icon" src="images/event_step.png"/>
	<h3>Step</h3>
</div>
<p>
	Executed within the game logic loop, by default this should execute 60 times
	a second. There are 3 types of Step event; Normal, Begin and End.<br>
	The Begin Step event is executed before all other Events.<br>
	The Normal Step event is executed just before all instance properties are
	updated, such as; speed, gravity, animation, etc. And before other events
	like collisions and input.<br>
	The End Step event is executed just before the drawing events, but after all
	other events.
</p>

<div id="draw" class="row">
	<img class="icon" src="images/event_draw.png"/>
	<h3>Draw</h3>
</div>
<p>
	Used for drawing. Executed when a new frame is about to be rendered, as such
	this event can run a variable number of times a second so it should not be
	used for game logic! There are 2 types of Draw event; Normal and GUI.<br>
	The Normal Draw event is where' most drawing takes place, it's aware of any
	transformations such as cameras, and will handle correct drawing for you.<br>
	The GUI Draw event happens after the Normal Draw event and disables any
	transformations and scaling. As such if a sprite is drawn at 0, 0 then it
	will be drawn at 0, 0 in the window regardless of any cameras. This makes it
	perfect for drawing user interfaces.
</p>

<div id="collision" class="row">
	<img class="icon" src="images/event_collision.png"/>
	<h3>Collision</h3>
</div>
<p>
	Executed when the current instance collides with another instance of a given
	a Object. The keywords "all" and "solid" can also be used to select those
	groups of instances. An instance can NOT collide with itself, but it can
	collide with other instances of the same object as it.
</p>

<div id="room-enter" class="row">
	<img class="icon" src="images/event_room_enter.svg"/>
	<h3>Room Enter</h3>
</div>
<p>
	The Room Enter event is executed for all instances that initially exist in
	a room or instances that are persistent between rooms, when a room is
	entered.
</p>

<div id="room-leave" class="row">
	<img class="icon" src="images/event_room_leave.svg"/>
	<h3>Room Leave</h3>
</div>
<p>
	The Room Leave event is executed for all instances that exist before moving
	to another room.
</p>

<div id="outside-room" class="row">
	<img class="icon" src="images/event_outside_room.svg"/>
	<h3>Outside Room</h3>
</div>
<p>
	The Outside Room event is executed when the instance lies completely outside
	the bounds of the room. This can be useful for deleting instances like
	bullets that leave the game area.
</p>


<h2>Input</h2>
<p>These are events triggered directly my human interaction.</p>

<div id="keyboard" class="row">
	<img class="icon" src="images/event_keyboard.png"/>
	<h3>Keyboard</h3>
</div>
<p>
	Executed when the given Keyboard key is in the given state. There is a wide
	selection of keys available. And three states for each; Press, Release and
	Hold.<br>
	Press events execute when the key is first pressed down.<br>
	Down events execute for each game step in which the key remains down.<br>
	Release events execute when the key stops being held down/is released.
</p>

<div id="mouse" class="row">
	<img class="icon" src="images/event_mouse.svg"/>
	<h3>Mouse</h3>
</div>
<p>
	Executed when the given Mouse button is in the given state. The three main
	buttons are represented; Left, Right and Middle. All of which have three
	states which can be checked; Down, Press and Release.<br>
	There is also the WheelUp and WheelDown even types, which don't have states
	and just execute when the mouse wheel is turned.
</p>

<div id="resize" class="row">
	<img class="icon" src="images/event_resize.svg"/>
	<h3>Resize</h3>
</div>
<p>Executed when the window/browser resizes.</p>
