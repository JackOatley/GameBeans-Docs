		<h1>GAME.camera</h1>
		
		<p>The GAME.camera object contains functions for dealing with cameras. Cameras allow an easy and convenient way of moving around and seeing inside a room. They can be assigned to follow an instance or even multiple instances!</p>
		
		
<!--
-->
<h3>GAME.camera.create( options )</h3>
<p>Creates a new camera. Takes a single options object. While it's possible to have multiple cameras, currently only the last created one has a visible effect as it just overwrites any previous camera changes. In the future, cameras will be able to be assigned to canvases, and thus act as a "view" into the room.</p>
<h4>Parameters:</h4>
<ul>
	<li><b>options</b> - OPTIONAL. An object containing advanced parameters.</li>
	<ul>
		<li><b>x</b> - The starting X position of the camera.</li>
		<li><b>y</b> - The starting Y position of the camera.</li>
		<li><b>follow</b> - The instance(s) for the camera to follow. See examples.</li>
		<li><b>width</b> - The width of the camera. Defaults to current room width.</li>
		<li><b>height</b> - The height of the camera. Defaults to current room height.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<code class="prettyprint">// follow a single instance
GAME.camera.create({
	follow: global.player
});

// follow 2 instances (camera placed at an average of their positions (in-between))
// note: "follow" takes multiple instances wrapped in an array
GAME.camera.create({
	follow: [
		global.player1,
		global.player2
	]
});

// follow 2 instances, with weighting
// note: weighting requires that the instance and it's weight be wrapped in an array
// "2" is like saying "weighted as if there's 2 of this instance"
GAME.camera.create({
	follow: [
		[global.player1, 2],
		global.player2
	]
});
	
// same result as above, but this time using fractions
GAME.camera.create({
	follow: [
		[global.player1, 0.66],
		[global.player2, 0.33]
	]
});</code>


<!--
-->
<h3>GAME.camera.update()</h3>
<p>Updates the cameras; their positions, bounds, etc. This is done internally at the end of the step event but before the draw event. You shouldn't need to use this function except in very specific circumstances (like mid-step and you're doing something that requires updated camera bounds, etc.)</p>
