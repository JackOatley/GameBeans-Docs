<h1>The GAME Object</h1>
		
<p>The GAME object is GameBeans' own JavaScript library. It mirrors the visual Actions, but also has a lot more functionality. GameBeans uses this so as to not pollute the global scope in JavaScript with a bunch of proprietary names that you might have wanted to use yourself. Therefore, any GameBeans function you want to use will be inside the GAME object.</p>
		
<p>Like so:</p>
<code class="prettyprint" style="display: block">GAME.draw.text( "Hi, I'm a GameBeans function!" );</code>
		
<p>In some cases, and for various reasons, the GAME object also contains functions native to JavaScript, in which case you can use either:</p>
<code>Math.sin( x ); // function from JavaScript's Math object
GAME.math.sin( x ); // copy in the GAME object</code>

<p>But this is not always true, sometimes the same/similar function is present but works in a slightly different way. With anything that deals in rotation and angles, JavaScript generally works with Radians, GameBeans works in Degrees. This is because Degrees are generally easier to understand and require less knowledge of the math behind it. It is however really simple to convert between these 2 values. For example:</p>
<code class="prettyprint" style="display: block">// converting between degrees and radians is as simple as
var degrees = 45;
var radians = degrees * GAME.math.DEGTORAD; // degrees to radians
degress = radians * GAME.math.RADTODEG; // radians to degrees

// Dealing with drawing transformations
var ctx = myCanvasElement.getContext( "2d" ); // normal JavaScript
ctx.rotate( (Math.PI / 180) * 45 );
GAME.draw.transform.rotate( 45 ); // using GameBeans
</code>
